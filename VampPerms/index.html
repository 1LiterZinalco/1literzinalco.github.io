# Vampirism
Based on the original document by Witchcrafter1<br>
Organized, written down, and rephrased by ThugPug43<br>
Then rewritten by 1LiterZinalco

# A Brief Introduction
- You need to remain calm, friendly, fair and objective at all times. Common sense, right?
- The first stage of the Helper, is a trial-phase. It lasts two weeks. If you misbehave or do *any-kind-of-shit* within this weeks, you'll be removed instantly. After the trial phase you're a "solid" Helper. To reach the stage of a Sr.Helpr or Trial-Mod, you just have to be active on the server and help other users. We'll notice.
- If you're offline for a few days it won't be a reason for us to just remove you from staff, even while you're on any kind of trial. Of course, if it's like a week or a month without any further information we would probably remove you from staff and give you the option to reapply once you're able to commit more time. So, please announce in advance that you are going on vacation or missing out on other reasons.
