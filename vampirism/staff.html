# Vampirism Staff
*Based on the original document by Witchcrafter1<br>
Organized, written down, and rephrased by ThugPug43<br>
Then rewritten by 1LiterZinalco*

# What we expect from you
You should...
- be friendly, helpful and reliable<br>
- have a certain mental maturity and the ability to be objective and calm<br>
- have a good understanding of spoken and written English<br>
- have experience with Minecraft, as well as Vampirism and its content<br>
- have of course already played on our server for some while<br>

# A Brief Introduction
- The first stage of the Helper is a trial-phase that lasts two weeks. If you misbehave or do *any-kind-of-shit* within these weeks, you'll be removed instantly. After the trial phase you're a "solid" Helper. To reach the stage of Trial-Mod you just have to be active on the server and help other users. We'll notice.
- If you're offline for a few days it won't be a reason for us to just remove you from staff, even while you're on any kind of trial. Of course, if it's like a week or a month without any further information we would probably remove you from staff and give you the option to reapply once you're able to commit more time. So, please announce in advance that you are going on vacation or missing out on other reasons.
- We sometimes need to work with - or talk about - personal data of the players. This can be their Dicord account, email address, entire chat histories or other information. Anything you know because you're staff, regardless of how exactly you found out, stays inside staff. By leaking any personal data you violate the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR/DSGVO) and make yourself punishable by laws in real life.

# Standard Punishments

- Ban
     - Permanent (ban evasion, being banned for the second time, extreme cases)
     - Temporary
          - Class A: 30 days (when reaching 3 warns, cheating/hacking/xray)
          - Class B: 60 days (bad offenses, no insight, attempted deception)
          - Class C: 90+ days (extreme cases)
- Warn
     - Permanent (bad offenses, no insight, attempted deception, cheating/hacking/xray)
     - Temporary (when breaking any of the rules and lower punishments do not apply, length depends on the offense, previous offenses, and whether repeated offense - if you don't know what to choose, ask higher staff)
          - Class A: ~7 days
          - Class B: ~14 days
          - Class C: 30+ days
- Mute
     - If a chat offense is so bad that a permanent mute would be appropriate, a warn or ban is actually more appropriate.
     - Temporary
          - Class A: 10-30 minutes (repeated caps, spam, ads, swearing)
          - Class B: X hours (mild insults and comparable)
- Verbal Warning (= asking to stop, eg. small chat misconducts)

Keep in mind that this is just a small overview with a few examples, which should give you a **vague idea** how to react to someone breaking the rules. For example, if someone is just straightup racist or discriminating others in chat, tempban them and tell higher staff to adjust the ban to permanent.
